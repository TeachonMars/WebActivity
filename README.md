# WebActivity
## Introduction
Teach on Mars offers a wide variety of mobile learning activities including courses, quizzes and games, and we regularly create new ones... but you may want more, right now! Good news, it is possible! With Teach on Mars, you can import a web content in a Teach on Mars training course just like any other activity. 
 
This can be useful for various purposes:
* Reuse a web content that you already own (from a previous LMS, for instance)
* Create a brand new type of activity (e.g. including VR or AR)
 
How can you create such a web activity? Simply use one of the various authoring tools available on the market. If you don’t know any, try to look for “mobile learning authoring tools” on your favorite search engine. (For more information, please refer to the “Known content type compatibility” section at the end of this document.)
Usage data like progress, score, success and time spent in your web activity can be sent to the Mission Center and added to the dashboards and exports. There are two ways to do this:
* Use the ToM JavaScript library in your web content
* Use a SCORM compatible content (1.2 and 2004 are supported)


You will find more detailed information in the [Web activity documentation](https://github.com/TeachonMars/WebActivity/raw/master/doc/ToM%20Web%20Activity%20documentation.pdf).
